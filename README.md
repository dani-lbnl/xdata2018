# XDATA 2018

Summer of Data Science - June to August 2018

You watched the course:

Challenge - deadline next Thursday:

**Experiment:**
Count the number of beans

1) Get 1/4 cup of beans, drop from a 10 inch height on a white letter-size paper and take a picture with your cell phone - frame the whole paper. Get more than 1 picture of the scene, and at different illuminations, flash, day light, etc. (remember: one data point is no data)

2) Exercise what you learned in class using your bean-pictures - don't forget to save all the intermediate steps for each image - you can create a stack with each step, create gif(s) and automated montage (hint for collage: help montage).
(note: it's not the quantity of files you produce, but how much you can use information acquired at each step)

3) Can you combine: shape, texture, color information to your analysis?  Can you combine info from different images of the same scene for better inference? Illustrate.

4) Draw the diagram of your algorithm


5) Build a computer program with the whole set of image transformations. (note: although you can use menus and interact with the picture during the test phase using the mouse, there's a lot to clean after recording your steps, erase your mistakes and keep going)



Enjoy! Award to the best project. Teams allowed.
